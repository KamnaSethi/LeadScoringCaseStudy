# LeadScoringCaseStudy

Problem Statement -  
•	An education company named X Education sells online Courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites like Google. Once people land on their website or fill up a form for the course. When people fill up the form by providing their email address or phone number they are classified as lead. On acquiring the leads sales team start making calls, writing emails. Through this process some of leads get converted while most do not.
•	The typical lead conversion rate is around 30%. This conversion rate is very poor. To make the process more efficient, company wishes to identify the most potential leads known as ‘Hot leads’. On successfully identifying this set of leads, the lead conversion rate would increase as sales team would focus more on communicating with the potential leads rather than contacting everyone.   

Business Goal-
•	To build a Logistic Regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads, this lead score will be used by the company to target potential leads. 
•	A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. more likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. 
•	The CEO wants the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
